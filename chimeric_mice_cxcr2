Roles of hepatocyte and myeloid CXC chemokine receptor-2 in liver recovery and regeneration after ischemia/reperfusion in mice. 

In the present study, chimeric mice were created through bone marrow transplantation (BMT) using 
wild-type and CXCR2-knockout mice, yielding selective expression of CXCR2 on hepatocytes (Hep) 
and/or myeloid cells (My) in the following combinations: Hep+/My+; Hep−/My+; Hep+/My−; Hep−/My−

Cell-specific regulatory effects of CXCR2 on cholestatic liver injury 

Blood was obtained by cardiac puncture. Measurement of serum alanine amino transferase (ALT) as an index of hepatocellular injury 
was made using a diagnosis kit by bioassay (Wiener Laboratories, Rosario, Argentina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
