RGB format -- histogram 
measure area,  gray value, standard deviation  of the whole slide 

for example, measure the area as well as the fluorescence intensity of a blob of cells 
making up an embryo.

###
the first thing is to split this composite image (8 bit) into separate channels.
image -- color -- split channels
make sure to work on a duplicte of the original image
and remane the duplicated image 

###
it is usually easier to work with a grayscale image, so change the current LUT / RGB to grays
lut -- grays

###
we will need to indicate the measurements we want as data 
analyze -- set measurements 
tick the measurement required, 
let us do area, peimeter (which is also the circumference of the bold), and for intensity,
including mean gray value, and integrated density.

mean is the sum of the gray values of all the pixels in the selection divided by the number of pixels,
integrated density (IntDen) is the sum of pixel values divided by the area, is the mean x the area of the roi
raw integrated density (RawIntDen) is the sum of pixels in the selection, this measurement automatically comes up when IntDen is checked.

since we will be using thresholding, make sure 'limit to threshold' is checked

###
note that the area of the selection is in units squared IF the images is calibrated (otherwise it will be in pixels squared)

# now let us do thresholding
image -- adjust -- threshold
let us work wiht Otsu

if you want to remove imperfections in the thresholded image, you need to create a binary image.
remember that clicking 'Apply' creates a binary image, but we can do this in another way.

###
let me show you a different way of creating a binary image, while keeping hte original image as is.
edit -- selection -- create mask
the original image that was threshold can still be reset.

###
we can fill up the holes, remove isolated pixels and smoothen the binary image.
process -- binary -- fill holes
process -- binary -- open

###
now since we just have 1 bolb to measure, we can select it using
edit -- selection -- create selection

###
if you directly to analyze -- measure, the values you get would be for the binary image (which is not ideal for the intensity measurement)
so we need to put this selection in the ROI manager, 
analyze -- tools -- roi manager
choose add on the roi manager
we can also rename the selection

and apply the selection to the original embryo image
clicking on measure on the roi manager adds measurements to the results table.

###
we can also take measurement of the fluorescence intensity of the other channel within the same roi.
and we can also threshold this channel to get the overall fluorescence of the cells
image -- adjust -- threshold 

without changing this selection to binary, go to edit -- selection -- create selection
add the selection to the roi manager, and rename it.
